# gnar

**Goals**

* Take the functionality of a site like Lobsters or HN and strip it down to its essence.
* Add functionality to fit how [Bendyworks](http://bendyworks.com) uses [awesome](http://awesome.bendyworks.com)
* Make it super mobile friendly
* (someday) send daily digest emails automatically instead of having comment threads. (See: [awesome_digest](https://github.com/bendyworks/awesome_digest))

## Technical stuff

* Hoplon and Castra on Ring
* [HoneySQL](https://github.com/jkk/honeysql) for Postgres database
* Boot for tasks
* [friend](https://github.com/cemerick/friend/) is used for its bcrypt wrapper, but is not used as the authentication system.

User auth inspired by [tailrecursion/hoplon-demos](https://github.com/tailrecursion/hoplon-demos/blob/d9f2b726c5b89f4cdaf69fdaac007c69ea545599/castra-chat/src/castra/demo/http/rules.clj)
