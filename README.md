# gnar

**Goals**

* Take the functionality of a site like Lobsters or HN and strip it down to its essence.
* Add functionality to fit how [awesome](http://awesome.bendyworks.com) was used at Bendyworks. (This reference may not make sense anymore.)
* Make it super mobile friendly. MOBILE FIRST DESIGN YO.
* (someday) send daily digest emails automatically instead of having comment threads. (See: [awesome_digest](https://github.com/bendyworks/awesome_digest))

## Technical stuff

* ~~Hoplon and Castra on Ring~~ In progress: Back end porting to Node.js in ClojureScript. Less real-time, more AJAX-y.
* ~~[HoneySQL](https://github.com/jkk/honeysql) for~~ Postgres database In progress: pg library for Node with ClojureScript wrapper
* Boot 2.0 for tasks
* ~~[friend](https://github.com/cemerick/friend/) is used for its bcrypt wrapper, but is not used as the authentication system.~~ Home-rolled authentication with bcrypt.

~~User auth inspired by [tailrecursion/hoplon-demos](https://github.com/tailrecursion/hoplon-demos/blob/d9f2b726c5b89f4cdaf69fdaac007c69ea545599/castra-chat/src/castra/demo/http/rules.clj)~~
